<p>
There are now twice as many computing devices connected to the Internet as people in the world, and yet hardly anyone knows that computers and the digital world in general are based on a different sort of math than we learned in school, namely, something called <i>discrete</i> mathematics. Discrete math deals with things that are separated and compartmentalized into distinct states, conditions, steps, intervals, phases; things done in chunks, bits, packets; stuff that makes beeps and clicks, goes on and off, lights up and goes dark again&#x2014;rhythmically or randomly.
</p>

<p>
The first chapter, our ground chapter, is called Chapter Null since we will be laying out the most fundamental ideas concerning what is discrete mathematics. So if computers are doing discrete math, then what was that stuff we learned in school? What sort of math is Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus? We will take a closer look at what is now called <i>continuous</i> math, the everyday math of physics and engineering in order to better understand discrete mathematics.

<i>Shall we begin?<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#x2014;Anonymous</i><br />
</p>

<p>
While the math in this book will be mainly discrete, we should take a quick look at <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis">continuous</a></i> math. By noting what makes something continuous or not continuous, we will better understand why mathematics is divided into these categories continuous and discrete.
</p>

<p>
We can think of <i>continuous</i> math as the calculation of things smoothly changing, in continuous motion. One typical problem with continuous math is describing the behavior of an object acted upon by a force, and the subsequent paths and trajectories these objects might take. But when we say continuous, we mean <i>smooth</i> continuous&#x2014;as in not broken up into chunks&#x2014;more than we mean <i>constant</i> continuous. One hallmark of continuous math is its extreme accuracy. Consider the calculations necessary to send satellites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program">Voyager 1 and 2</a> on missions into the solar system. Voyager 2 was placed into perfect orbits with both Jupiter and Saturn in order to gain speed from a gravitational “slingshot effect.” The precision of these calculations is phenomenal, to say the least.
</p>

<p>
Continuous math can also be <i>deterministic</i> in that knowing facts such as an object’s position and speed allows us to <i>determine</i> its precise position at a later or even an earlier time. For example, if you know a car has passed you on the road at exactly 2:00 p.m. going an ever-steady  \(60\) miles per hour, you can predict it will be \(1\) mile further down the road \(1\) minute later, and then \(60\) miles further \(1\) hour later. Again, the car's motion is continuous in the sense that it is not broken up into chunks by stops.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a very simple formula for knowing the distance traveled based on a speed and a time&#x2014;assuming continuous motion:
</p>

\begin{align*}
d = vt
\end{align*}

<p>
So if our speed is \(60\) miles per hour and our time underway is \(30\) minutes
</p>

\begin{align*}
d & = \frac{60 \, miles}{hour} \cdot \frac{30 \, minutes}{1} \\
& = \frac{60 \, miles}{\cancel{hour}} \cdot \frac {1 \, \cancel{hour}}{2} \\
& = \frac{60 \, miles }{2} \\
& = 30 \, miles.
\end{align*}


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/continuous1.png" alt="continuous1.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>The distance :: time ratio</p>
</div>

<p>
Just by looking at the smooth, continuous line in the graph above, we see that any increment of time, however small we might make it, will result in some new distance. For example,
</p>

\begin{align*}
d & = 60 \, mph \cdot 0.50001 \, hours \\
& = 30.0006 \, miles
\end{align*}

<p>
or roughly \(30\) miles and a few inches, which, again, our graph can tell you&#x2014;if you enlarge it or use a magnifying glass on it. This means we can chart an <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/infinitesimal">infinitesimally</a> short amount of distance traveled from an infinitesimally short increase in time from the last time we did the calculation. So when we speak of something being continuous, it usually means that input and output are plottable on a very finely divided line&#x2014;so fine that it is, practically speaking, no longer individual jagged, stop-and-go stair steps, rather, a smooth, continuous line. This may seem obvious, but it was a big philosophical conundrum for a long time, a mathematical <i>paradox</i>, as they say. Now, should we consider the change from \(30\) miles to \(30.0001\) a "bump-up," i.e., an abrupt jump that looks like a stair step? Maybe? What about a change in time that results in a change from \(30\) miles to \(30.00000000001\) miles? That would only be adding \(0.000000634\) (\(6.34e\!-\!7\)) inches&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
One mathematical construct or model for such finely divided or differentiated things is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line">real number line</a>. For all intents and purposes, the fineness, the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/granular">granularity,</a> the number of “ticks” on a time line should <i>map</i> or correspond exactly to the infinite number of points or “spots” on the real number line. Said differently, each tick of a clock&#x2014;however short the ticking intervals are&#x2014;will have a sister place on the real number line. But again, how small do the changes from one spot to the next have to be in order to start calling it a smooth slope rather than a jagged stair step?<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
So we're beginning to have a usable idea of what a continuous phenomenon is. In algebra you probably discussed all sorts of <i>continuous functions</i>. But then you might have seen something like this:
</p>

\begin{align*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{x}
\end{align*}


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/oneoverx1.png" alt="oneoverx1.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Y approaches infinity as X approaches 0</p>
</div>

<p>
Here we notice that as we try to plot the function from negative \(x\) to \(0\) there doesn’t seem to be a value for \(f(x) = 1/x\) right at \(x = 0\) &#x2014;which is, of course, consistent with what we’ve learned in math, namely, that to divide by zero is undefined, i.e., impossible, meaning there cannot be a value at \(x = 0\), which therefore means \(1/x\) is not continuous. The result is a graph that clearly goes crazy up close on either side of \(0\). Your algebra course probably included this in the mix just to show you an oddity, but there are many phenomena do not progress in a continuously incremental way. Consider this graph: 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/test4.png" alt="test4.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Big stair-step, but still continuous</p>
</div>

<p>
What sort of function would produce such a graph? Maybe you recall something like \(f(x) = 3\), which would simply be a straight horizontal line at \(y = 3\). But what sort of function would suddenly jog up and over? Consider
</p>

\begin{align*}
 s(x) = \left\{ 
   \begin{array}
        {r@{\quad \mathrm{if} \quad}l} 1  & \, x \geq 0, \\
                   \!\! 0  &  x < 0
   \end{array} \right .
 \end{align*}

<p>
This representation makes sense, even though it doesn’t seem to actually be discontinuous. But then consider
</p>

\begin{align*}
 s(x) = \left\{ 
   \begin{array}
        {r@{\quad \mathrm{if} \quad}l} 0.03  & \, x \geq 0, \\
                   \!\! -0.03  &  x < 0
   \end{array} \right .
 \end{align*}


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/test5.png" alt="test5.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Smaller stair-step, still continuous</p>
</div>

<p>
So if we keep making the two conditions closer and closer, the jog from the lower section to the higher will get smaller . . . until it collapses back to our normal-looking \(f(x) = 0\)
</p>

\begin{align*}
 s(x) = \left\{ 
   \begin{array}
        {r@{\quad \mathrm{if} \quad}l} 0.003  & \, x \geq 0, \\
                   \!\! -0.003  &  x < 0
   \end{array} \right .
 \end{align*}


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/jog2.png" alt="jog2.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5: </span>Tiny stair-step, still continuous</p>
</div>

<p>
Now it’s barely discernible. What about excluding \(0\) as we did with \(f(x) = 1/x\)?
</p>

\begin{align*}
 s(x) = \left\{ 
   \begin{array}
        {r@{\quad \mathrm{if} \quad}l} 0  & \, -2 < x < 0, \\
                   \!\! 1  &  0 < x < 2
   \end{array} \right .
 \end{align*}




<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/gap1.png" alt="gap1.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 6: </span>No longer continuous</p>
</div>


<p>
Here we have the discontinuity at \(0\) not dissimilar to  \(f(x) = 1/x\). Notice also that these last few functions are defined by breaking up their behavior over separate intervals. Instead of just one interruption calling for two <i>conditions</i>, we might have many interruptions and many conditions&#x2026;
</p>

\begin{align*}
 s(x) = \left\{ 
   \begin{array}
        {r@{\quad \mathrm{if} \quad}l} 0  & \, -2 < x < 0, \\
                   \!\! 1  &  0 < x < 2, \\
                   \!\! 2  &  2 < x < 4, \\
                   \!\! 3  &  4 < x < 6.
   \end{array} \right .
 \end{align*}

<p>
&#x2026;but at some point we should switch to a different notation and depiction.
</p>


<p>
<b>The World of Discrete Mathematics</b>
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the preface, <i>discrete</i> math deals with separate, <i>discrete</i> processes, i.e., things that are usually represented with non-decimal, non-fractional whole numbers, <i>systems</i> of finite, non-smoothly associated objects&#x2014;jagged, jumpy stuff.
</p>

<p>
To go from the world of continuous to discrete, sometimes all we need to do is simplify. Consider this “regular” map, accurate spatially-geographically, meaning the area and angles are true
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/Manhattan.png" alt="Manhattan.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 7: </span>Google map of Manhattan and the East River</p>
</div>

<p>
Then consider these two subway maps. Subway map A was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lella_Vignelli">Lella Vignelli</a> and subway map B was designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hertz_Associates">Michael Hertz Associates</a>:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/subwaymaps.png" alt="subwaymaps.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 8: </span>Thematic maps of New York City’s subway system</p>
</div>

<p>
Most of us have seen these sorts of subway maps. Subway maps A and B are a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_map">thematic map</a>. A thematic map might start with a regular map, but emphasizes a special <i>theme</i>. Comparing the maps in Figure 8, subway maps A and B, we see that map A is highly simplified, or <i>stylized</i>&#x2014;to the point of not really representing the geographical truth of that part of New York City. But then map B does seems a bit stylized as well. Is it just a Google map with the subway lines added on top? We can't be sure. Compare the Williamsburg Bridge in all three maps (noted by the big red sphere). All three bridges are shown differently&#x2014;although it's safe to say the Google map shows how the bridge is situated in the real world, i.e., its real length and where it connects at each bank of the East River (cartographers might call this areal and angular integrity). In any case, the Google map seems to have more detail, especially along the shore, than the other two maps. And yet map A, bright-and-simple, has everything we really need as subway riders:
</p>

<li>the subway lines</li>
<li>the subway stops</li>
<li>the major streets associated with the subway lines</li>
<li>roughly where the subway lines are geographically&#x2026;</li>
</ul>

<p>
&#x2026;where “roughly” is probably good enough, right?
</p>

<p>
Now, let's consider one of the main differences between continuous and discrete, namely, how we get from one place or situation to the next&#x2014;smoothly or in separate jumps? Of the three maps, the Google map, as well as subway map B might allow you to think in terms of time and space normally, while subway map A not so well. Let's think about time itself, and how we might get in a car&#x2014;or in this case a subway train&#x2014;and find out where we are if we know elapsed time and subway train velocity&#x2014;just like we did above with the car going down the road at \(60\) miles per hour for thirty minutes. If we’re using the Google map we might have an equation just like \(d=vt\) to tell us how far we've gone relative to the time and the velocity. And yes, \(d=vt\) might work with subway map B as well. But what about super-stylized subway map A? Because its spatial authenticity has been so generalized, we can’t really plug in a time and a velocity and know how far we’ve gone down the orange, brown, green, and yellow lines. Those subway lines seem to go straight then suddenly make crazy sharp turns. That’s not at all how the lines run in reality. But we might still create a formula as such for map A, however it cannot be based on time and velocity. Let’s consider a very small corner of the New York City Subway, namely, the Staten Island Railroad:
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 9: </span>Staten Island Railroad</p>
</div>


<p>
this function:
</p>

\begin{align*}
S(n) = vt
\end{align*}



<p>
Which map do you like best? It's probably a matter of taste. Again, neither of the subway maps could be called accurate for exact measurements. However, the bright-and-simple mapping style depicted on the left has come to dominate subway maps. Now, let's see a really clever simplification from the early eighteenth century called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg">The Seven Bridges of Königsberg</a></i> by the Swiss mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>.
</p>

<p><img src="images/eulerbridges.png" alt="eulerbridges.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 10: </span>The seven bridges of Königsberg</p>
</div>

<p>
Euler, who lived and worked in the Prussian city of Königsberg, wondered if he could cross each of the seven bridges over the Pregel River connecting the city's north bank, south bank, and the two islands one after the other and, with no repeated crossings, deliver him back to his starting point.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the three images above, it seems the last image has no real geography to it at all. But if you study how the original map is thematically stylized into the middle map, then you might be ready for the next leap of abstraction, namely, that the whole issue of land, rivers, and bridges can be reduced to something of points and lines&#x2014;with no concern for its reality geographically. This was quite the sensation back in the 1730s
</p>

<p>
But to what end are we making this crazy spatial abstraction? It turns out the main motivation for this geography-free diagram was the simple question of whether a person could walk across each and every bridge in succession and get back to the starting point&#x2014;without retracing, i.e., recrossing a bridge.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Seven Bridges of Königsberg</i> problem is considered the birth of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a></i>, a prominent member of the discrete mathematics family. A graph in this context is not a Cartesian graph, but a set of points, or, technically, <i>vertices</i> (singular: <i>vertex<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></i>) and the lines, or, technically <i>edges</i> that connect the vertices.
</p>


<p>
Consider a coin-operated turnstile<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>. You put a coin or token in and it allows you to push through the metal bar; otherwise, the bar blocks your passage.

<p>
We can model a pay turnstile as a system with two states: <b>locked</b> and <b>unlocked</b>. Let's look at a table:

In regular math we see <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">functions</a></i>, expressions, equations. A function is a statement, an equation is a statement, a mathematical expression is also a statement of some mathematical relationship, hopefully accurate and true. Math builds, derives, juxtaposes functions, expressions, equations to get at some basic, fundamental truth of the matter at hand. With an equation like \(y = y_0e^{kt}\) we see a factory

of sorts that takes a thing \(y\), perhaps a bacteria blob&#x2014;at an initial starting time \(t = 0\), that is, the blob's state at $y_0$&#x2014;and multiplies it by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">Euler's "magic" constant</a> \(e\) raised to the power of \(kt\), where \(t\) is time and \(k\) is a constant, i.e., \(e^{kt}\). What is this for? What does it do? Well, to begin answering this question many mathematics teachers would first want their students to know where the equation came from&#x2014;maybe not the whole historical rendition of when and who plucked it out of the <i>mathematical void</i>&#x2014;but students should see that it is <i>derived</i> using valid, mathematically-legal substitutions and simplifications from a more basic mathematical statement
</p>

\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
\end{align*}

. . . then the students do some homework problems, and maybe see in on a test. And there the ball stops&#x2014;until a day comes when one of them must use the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth">exponential rate of growth</a> (or decay) dependent on initial size</i> formula in a real-world setting&#x2014;invariably on a computer; invariably in a much messier situation than the Calculus text problem set.

We will use the language <i>Racket</i> the computerization of math and numerical things Emacs Lisp is a "dialect" of Common Lisp, which means it does a few things slightly different than mainstream Common Lisp, but is still a Lisp programming language. Why should we use Emacs Lisp? Because it is tightly integrated with the editor we will use, Emacs. And why should we use Lisp? Because it is a very powerful language with a long and storied history. Some people say Lisp is <i>the</i> most powerful language.
</p>

<p>
Being a Lisp, <i>Elisp</i>, as Emacs Lisp is nicknamed, comes from a long tradition of higher-level research computer science. Lisp (an acronym for LISt Processor) is very old (only Fortran is older) and is based on <i>functional</i> and <i>declarative</i> computing paradigms. What is a <i>functional</i> and a <i>declarative</i> programming language? We will explore these concepts as we learn Elisp. But for now just think of a regular mathematical function such as
</p>

\begin{align*}
f(x) = x^2.
\end{align*}

The first thing we see is that we <i>declare</i> rather than describe imperatively a relationship. Before the Persian scholar al-Khwarizmi of the ninth century, mathematics could be rather wordy. Al-Khwarizmi is credited with starting Algebra, which is based on the concept of symbols such as letters representing numbers. Therefore, we can write

&rarr; <i>make a copy of 5 and put it in a new memory location</i><br />
